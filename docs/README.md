## docs

How to get started with development for raisr.

Clone the project [here](https://github.com/movehand/raisr).

Install all of the dependencies with this:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy scipy image matplotlib
```

We are still getting the project documented, but once that is complete we will put up the rest of the docs.
